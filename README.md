# Binary Expression Evaluator
Understanding Recursive Data Structures.

## Dependencies

- Windows 10 / Mac
- c++11


## Description

Essentially, this aims to create a Binary Search Tree in C++, which can be implemented
to solve and display Arithmetic Expressions of two possible forms: _"A+B"_ and _"AB*"_. This was also intended to 
test my understanding of other useful data structures such as Stacks and Queues. With this in mind, I was also hoping to better understand 
how a compiler might possibly analyze and parse syntax through a trivial approach.

## Features

- Arithmetic Expressions can be displayed appropriately with balanced parentheses such as:
- _((((A+B)-C)+D)*E)_ or _((4* 2)*(3+6))_ where each inner node is an operator and every leaf is an operand.
- Secondly, while this program is minimal, it does make an attempt to implement a Map using a BST with key-value pairs of the form: 
- _(Key, Value)_

## Note

There's perhaps a lot of issues as I didn't really chose to test how certain inputs would break my already 
buggy code, but for the most part everything seems to work. Again, this is by no means professional as I was simply messing around and
shoving concepts together. 

_Out of Boredom and curiosity, this is my Creation._
